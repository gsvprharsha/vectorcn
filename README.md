  Minimalist marketing UI blocks for modern tech websites.<br>
  Built with <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, <strong>shadcn/ui</strong>, and a love for clean code aesthetics.
</h2>

VectorCN is a collection of tech-minimalist UI components and marketing blocks built with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui, designed for developers, designers, and startups who want clean, copy-paste-ready building blocks for modern web interfaces. It emphasizes clarity, composability, and developer-first aesthetics — combining utility-first styling with purposeful design to help you ship fast without sacrificing visual precision.

## Current Features

- **2 Hero Sections** – Minimal, responsive hero blocks to start your page strong  
- **4 Notification Bars** – Versatile banners for announcements, beta invites, or changelogs  
- **Button Primitives** – Reusable, styled buttons with consistent interaction states  
> [!NOTE]  
> Designed for makers, devs, and tech teams who value clarity and utility in their design.

## Philosophy

### Design like a developer. Build like a designer.

- **Tech Minimalism** – Inspired by terminal UIs, developer tools, and SaaS dashboards.
- **Composable Sections** – Drop in and remix with ease  
- **Copy-Paste First** – No wrappers, no bloat — just usable code  
- **Monospace Hints + Dashed Borders** – Because style should echo structure  

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/vectorcn
cd vectorcn
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This project uses ``pnpm``, but works with ``npm`` or ``yarn`` too.

## Usage
All blocks are standalone components — import and use them in your Next.js project or marketing site. Just copy and paste :)

## Coming Soon
- More Hero Sections
- Content Sections for product storytelling
- Features Blocks to showcase highlights
- More UI Primitives (e.g. badges, cards)
- Like/Dislike Feedback on components
- Color Playground to preview Tailwind themes live
